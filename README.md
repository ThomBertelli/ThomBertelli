# üí´ About Me:

Additionally, my experience includes Java and Spring Boot as well.<br>I have more than a decade of experience in customer service and sales, with the drive to achieve goals, ensure satisfaction from customers‚Äîand constantly improve. <br>I‚Äôve always been fascinated by technology, and since I was a child, I wanted to work in the field.
